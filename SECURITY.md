## Reporting a Vulnerability

If the vulnerability can be reported without revealing exploitable specifics, please open an issue.

If the vulnerability can't be reported publically without leaving an obvious exploit in the public eye please email me at jeremy@rifkin.dev or reach out to me or the Together C & C++ staff team on Discord ([discord.gg/tccpp](https://discord.gg/tccpp)).

I will do my best to get back to you within a day.
